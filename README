This is [ydiff](https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff), _heavily_ stripped down to only support:

- reading unified diffs to stdin
- py3.6+
- utf-8
- side-by-side rendering

And, modified to have:

- less colorful colorization

Essentially, it is now purely a unified diff -> side-by-side renderer.
Why? Because I'm definitely not smart enough to port it to more performant languages.

I use the following git aliases:

	[alias]
	    d = "!git diff | ydiff | less"
	    dc = "!git diff --cached | ydiff | less"
	    s = "!rev=${1:-HEAD}; git diff $rev~1 $rev | ydiff | less"

	[color]
		diff = never

If you have Cython (`pip install Cython`), use `make` and you'll have a `ydiff-bin` you can use.
According to my tests, it's faster. I'll have better numbers soon.

I've only partially figured out static compilation on Linux x86_64.
I say partially since staticx does all the heavy lifting.
