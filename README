This is [ydiff](https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff), heavily stripped down to only support:

- reading unified diffs to stdin
- py3.6+
- utf-8
- side-by-side rendering

Essentially, it is a unified diff -> side-by-side renderer.

I use the following git aliases:

	[alias]
	    d = "!git diff | ydiff | less"
	    dc = "!git diff --cached | ydiff | less"
	    s = "!rev=${1:-HEAD}; git diff $rev~1 $rev | ydiff | less"

	[color]
		diff = never
