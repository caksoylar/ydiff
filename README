This is ydiff, modified to only support git, py3.6+, and utf-8 because my use case is smaller.

To install, symlink ydiff.py as git-ydiff somewhere on your PATH.

I use the following git aliases:

	[alias]
	    d = ydiff -s -w0 --wrap
	    dc = ydiff -s -w0 --wrap --cached
	    s = "!showdiff () { rev=${1:-HEAD}; git d $rev~1 $rev; }; showdiff $1"

	[color]
		diff = never
