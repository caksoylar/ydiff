This is [ydiff](https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff), simplified to only support:

- reading unified diffs to stdin
- py3.6+
- utf-8

Essentially, it is a unified diff highlighter.

I use the following git aliases:

	[alias]
	    d = "!git diff | ydiff -s -w0 --wrap"
	    dc = "!git diff --cached | ydiff -s -w0 --wrap"
	    s = "!rev=${1:-HEAD}; git diff $rev~1 $rev | ydiff -s -w0 --wrap"

	[color]
		diff = never
